## Bits, Brains, Blue Planet

I graduated with my PhD from [UC Berkeley](berkeley.edu) at the [Redwood Center for theoretical neuroscience](redwood.berkeley.edu). My advisors was [Michael R Deweese](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/people/mike-deweese/). My thesis committee chair was [Bruno Olshausen](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/people/bruno-olshausen/). The rest of my thesis committee included - [Jitendra Malik](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~malik/), [Pieter Abbeel](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/) and [Alyosha Efros](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~efros/).

I spent my PhD  understanding sensorimotor representations in machines and in brains. I also worked on fast inference algorithms for high dimensional probabilistic models with MCMC methods. I also worked on applications of machine learning to problems in climate science. I am deeply interested in understanding the relationship between meditation and neuroscience.

I was a research scientist at [Berkeley National Lab](www.lbl.gov) for a while. I also used to be the Head of AI and Engineering at [Terrafuse](terrafuse.ai). Presently, I am a co-investigator at the [Sadhguru Center for a Conscious Planet](https://www.bidmc.org/research/research-by-department/anesthesia-critical-care-and-pain-medicine/research-centers/sadhguru-center). 

If you have some money to spare and want to contribute to tackling climate change, I recommend taking a look at [cauvery calling](https://www.ishaoutreach.org/en/cauvery-calling/campaigns/cauvery-calling-action-now-mayur-mudigonda)
